# Changelog

All notable changes. Dates are local; versions follow semver once tagged.

## 0.2.1

### Added
- Server-side filters on the request log (`provider`, `model` ref or bare id, `key_id`,
  `status` 2xx/error) that compose with the cursor.
- Logs page: filterable, cursor-paginated request history with the same attempts detail as
  Activity.
- Structured logs: `RROUTER_LOG_FORMAT=json` and one access line per finished request
  (request id, provider, model, status, latency, first-output time, endpoint, key id).
- Usage retention: `RROUTER_USAGE_RETENTION_DAYS` deletes old usage/attempts in a daily sweep
  (expired cache rows always go) and runs `PRAGMA optimize`.
- CSV export of the filtered request log (`/api/usage/export.csv`) and an Export CSV action
  on the Logs page; rows stream in 1000-row cursor pages.
- Cursor pagination for the request log (`/api/usage` `before`/`before_id` and
  `next_before`), so history can be paged without time-window guessing.
- Budget windows: per-key budgets reset daily, weekly or monthly (UTC), enforced alongside the
  lifetime cap; `spent_*` on the key row is scoped to the current window.
- Opt-in exact-match response cache for non-streaming requests (`RROUTER_CACHE=sqlite`), with
  TTL, size bound, `x-rrouter-cache` hit/miss/bypass and hit rows that record zero tokens.
- The dashboard prompts for `RROUTER_ADMIN_TOKEN` and keeps it per tab, so a proxy-fronted
  deployment can authenticate its own admin API.

## 0.2.0 — first public release

### Gateway

- One binary serving OpenAI Chat, OpenAI Responses and Anthropic Messages on `/v1`, with
  incremental translation in both directions (streaming and non-streaming).
- `/v1/embeddings`, `/v1/models` (list and by id), and forwarded
  `/v1/messages/count_tokens`, `/v1/responses/compact`, `/v1/images/generations`,
  `/v1/audio/speech`, `/v1/audio/transcriptions` and `/v1/audio/voices` for providers that
  implement them (501 otherwise, never an estimate).
- Subscription sign-in for Claude and Codex, GitHub Copilot device flow, API keys for OpenAI,
  Anthropic, Gemini, DeepSeek, Groq, OpenRouter, xAI, Mistral, Together, Cerebras, Ollama.
- Credential refresh ahead of expiry with a per-account lock; encrypted at rest (AES-256-GCM).

### Routing

- `provider/model`, aliases (one hop), and combos; priority-ordered fallback with a circuit
  breaker, `Retry-After` handling, and half-open probes.
- Conversation affinity: equal-priority accounts are pinned per conversation so prompt caches
  stay warm; unrelated conversations still spread.
- Same-dialect requests are forwarded as the client wrote them — Anthropic `cache_control` and
  OpenAI cache fields survive; only routing fields are patched.
- Explicit `provider/model` never widens to other providers, even for ids the catalog does not
  know.

### Keys and limits

- Per-key RPM, TPM, token budget, model allowlist (exact refs and `provider/*`), expiry, and
  per-key spend from recorded usage.
- Hashed at rest, plaintext shown once; enforcement returns `403`/`429` with stable codes in
  the caller's dialect.

### Model registry

- Merged catalog + provider `/models` + models.dev metadata + custom rows; capabilities, limits,
  pricing; a real 16-token test through the same planner and dispatcher a client would use.
- Only connected providers are listed; models.dev enriches, never adds.

### Dashboard

- Activity redesign: readouts with window deltas, stacked traffic chart with error lane and
  tooltip, ranked models, request log with attempt timeline, tokens/latency/first-output split.
- Setup wizard for the first run: connect an account, create a key, send and watch the first
  request.
- Playground for streaming Chat/Messages; Settings for branding and runtime facts; white-label
  branding applied live.
- Requests can be filtered by model, errors, and key; every number is server-side.

### Operations

- `usage`/`attempts` accounting, Prometheus `/metrics`, `/health` and a self-probe
  (`rrouter --healthcheck`), graceful shutdown with a bounded drain.
- Request ids (`x-request-id`) and per-attempt records, so a fallback is visible in
  `GET /api/usage/{id}` and in Activity instead of inferred.
- `RROUTER_ADMIN_TOKEN` for the admin API, `RROUTER_MAX_CONCURRENCY` backpressure (503 +
  Retry-After), `RROUTER_MAX_ATTEMPTS`, `RROUTER_SHUTDOWN_GRACE_SECS`.
- Docker (distroless, nonroot, healthcheck), compose, single-replica Kubernetes manifest,
  systemd unit, Caddy example with admin auth.
- `scripts/backup.sh` (consistent SQLite snapshot), `scripts/load_test.py`, `scripts/verify.sh`,
  live e2e and OAuth smokes.

### Fixed

- Claude OAuth: the registered callback host (`localhost`, not `127.0.0.1`), `state` in the
  token exchange, and an immediate loopback answer instead of a hung page.
- OAuth requests now claim a current Claude Code version, which newer models require.
- Cache markers were dropped when a request was rebuilt; same-dialect bodies are now forwarded.
- Activity counted requests one bucket early; windows now end in the bucket containing "now".
- Streamed responses recorded `streamed=false`; the flag and time-to-first-output are recorded.
- The shutdown grace started at process boot instead of on the signal, so every gateway
  exited after 20 s; the timer now starts with SIGTERM/SIGINT and exits in milliseconds when
  nothing is streaming.

### Known limitations

- Codex's subscription backend does not serve `/responses/compact` (OpenAI API keys do).
- OAuth sign-in needs the browser to reach the loopback callback; remote hosts need an SSH
  port-forward (documented) — there is no paste-the-URL fallback yet.
- Limits are in tokens; USD budgets track the catalog price in a later release.
